Void Codex – Development Brief

Void Codex is a 2D space-strategy roguelike inspired by FTL, with a strong focus on crew training, sector biomes, and a codex-reading mechanic required before each hyperspace jump. The game is built with LibGDX, using Scene2D for UI. The core loop revolves around managing a ship, training crew competencies, exploring procedurally generated biomes, reading lore pages to unlock navigation data, and surviving encounters.

Core Gameplay

Player commands a single starship traveling through sectors.

Each sector belongs to a unique biome (ion storms, nebula jungles, crystal clusters, derelict graveyards, etc.) that modifies events and hazards.

Combat is paused real-time: manage power, weapons, systems, and crew placement.

Crew members have skill progressions (engineering, medical, navigation, combat, research).

Before each hyperspace jump, the player must read 1–2 pages of the “Void Codex”—lore entries that also reveal mechanical info about the next biome or encounter.

Key Systems

Ship Grid System: Rooms laid out on a grid, each room mapped to a subsystem.

Crew AI: Crew navigates between rooms, performs tasks, and gains XP.

Codex System: Loads narrative pages that contain lore, hints, and gameplay modifiers.

Biome Generator: Creates sector types with modifiers to events, hazards, and enemy loadouts.

Combat System: Power distribution, subsystem damage, fires, breaches, oxygen levels.

Event System: Branching events influenced by crew skills and codex knowledge.

Progression: Unlockable ships, crew backgrounds, biome-specific advantages.

Technical

Framework: LibGDX 1.14, Java 17, Scene2D + FreeType.

Rendering: 2D sprites, Scene2D UI for panels and codex pages.

Data: JSON/TOML for events, biomes, ship layouts; optional Ink scripts for codex text.

Architecture: Screen-based (MainMenu, ShipScreen, CodexScreen, CombatScreen).

Style: Minimalist pixel-style UI, readable typography, clean layout.

Design Goals

Tactical depth without overwhelming complexity.

Atmosphere of mystery and knowledge-driven exploration.

High replayability via biomes, events, and random maps.

Reading pages create a rhythm of tension, reflection, and preparation.
