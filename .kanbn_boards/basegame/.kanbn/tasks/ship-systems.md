# Ship Systems

Currently there are no totoal energies, it show show the total energy (starting as 8), ensure that right clicking removes power, left clicking allocates energy if it were not there.

instead of using text createand use icons for the different engine systems
on hover it should deisplay a description of what is it. Ensure that clicking on them powers them. 

all tiles should have white greyish background when full of oxigen and change into red if no oxigen on the tile, start with a tile wihtout oxigen and start filling it oxigen (if the oxigen system is powered) start with 100 of energy (to test) and all systems levels unlocked, meaning that can allocate more energy to make them better like more shield or more oxigen
